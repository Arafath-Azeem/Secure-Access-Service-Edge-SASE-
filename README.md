# Secure-Access-Service-Edge-SASE

 Every enterprise and MSP’s are now getting aware of what SASE is, and the humongous power it has to adapt to the unprecedented cyber needs of the organization. The rapid rate of cloud-based applications usage are spiking, and majority of users, devices and data are moving to a remote work environment. The key for an enterprise to survive in this challenging time is to adapt to a new model of network infrastructure built around SASE. The legacy network infrastructure needs to be abandoned quickly or else risk going obsolete in the next 5 years. According to a recent data published, 51% of CEO’s do not know what their industry will look like in 2023. Understanding the essence of cyber needs for your industry can be the margin between skyrocketing or going bankrupt.

## What does SASE enhance?

SASE is the integration of various cloud security solutions; mainly, Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Secure Web Gateway (SWG), and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Remote Browser Isolation (RBI). The combined value of all these core functionalities into one single SASE model of architecture grants vital data and threat protection for an enterprise. The four-core offerings of SASE functionality are:

## Granular Visibility of cloud resources

SASE offers enterprise high data visibility and monitoring at a granular level. Absence of a proper data visibility paradigm keeps the organization in the dark. Comprehensive visibility enables the organization to identify and regulate data patterns accordingly. This is a critical for an enterprise that needs demonstration of regulatory compliance.

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Data loss prevention policies are offered at the granular level by the SASE’s architecture model. DLP policies in SASE helps to identify sensitive data to protect that is at rest within the cloud’s SaaS environment and on – premise application. It is vital that confidential information does not leak and also prevention of exfiltration from the web is stopped.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

SASE model offers a single sign-on (SSO) mode of authentication that serves as the sole point of authentication across all managed services and applications. Authenticating users is very vital step in creating a smart, intelligent and context-based security. It is a superior format of authentication than multi-factor authentication (MFA). IAM is crucial in protecting the identity of the users in an enterprise from malicious threats and sniffers trying to access accounts.

## Unified Threat Management (UTM) 

Organizations today must be able to adapt to the changing cyber requirements. The growing rate of cyber attack methods will only keep increasing along the way. For an enterprise, SASE offers a solid platform that blocks known and zero- day malware during any instance of upload, download or rest. Additionally, malicious web destinations are blocked preventing malware infections and phishing schemes of any sort. In case, there is an infiltration, either internal or external the process is stopped immediately preventing further leakage.

## Secure Web Gateway (SWG)

Secure Web gateway solutions protect Web-surfing PCs from infection and enforce company policies. Also, a solution that filters unwanted software/malware from user-initiated internet traffic and enforces corporate and regulatory policy compliance. These gateways include URL filtering, malicious-code detection and application controls for popular Web-based applications. Native or integrated data leak prevention is also increasingly included.

## Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)

RBI moves the execution of a user’s browser activity from the client device to a remote server — hosted on-premises or in the cloud. This protects against browser-based security exploits and provides a means of anonymous browsing and risk-free open Internet access. As the user browses the public Internet, the remote browser is isolated from the user’s physical endpoint and enterprise network. Therefore, any attacks on the remote web browsing session are constrained to the virtual environment. RBI also helps with data protection, especially in the case of unmanaged or untrusted devices being used to access confidential or sensitive information.

 ## Is SASE the ultimate answer?

In the present-era solutions like CASB, ZTNA, RBI and SWG functioning alone don’t have much meaning for an organisation’s security. Industry demands require a compact and integrated solutions rather than a partial solution. Enterprise’s that are seeking to acquire SASE’s solution should consider these below points:

## The expanding attack surfaces of Ransomware

The attack perimeter in the cyber industry has shown no sign of slowing down. Hackers/Cyber criminals are always out there trying to penetrate an enterprise to steal PII dats. There can be several internal and external causes that might put the organization in a vulnerable position. Even internal human error is a top most. SASE offers services in a compact package which offers defence in-epth

As data is moving off-site and into the clouds beyond the touch of legacy security technologies like onsite firewalls. SASE’s platform and model is the ideal way to be an enterprise of the modern era with modern security tools.
